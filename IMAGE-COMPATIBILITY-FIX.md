## Image Upload and Web App Compatibility - Fixed! ✅

### Issues Identified:
1. **Field Mapping Mismatch**: Admin panel saves images as `image` field, but multivendor-web expects `logoUrl` and `bannerUrl`
2. **Contact Information**: Admin saves `email`, web app expects `contactEmail`

### Solutions Implemented:

#### 1. **Updated Restaurant Service** (Admin Panel)
- Modified `createRestaurant()` to map fields correctly:
  - `image` → `logoUrl` and `bannerUrl` 
  - `email` → `contactEmail`
- Updated `updateRestaurant()` with same field mapping
- Maintained backward compatibility with original field names

#### 2. **Updated RestaurantCard Component** (Web App)
- Added support for new field names (`logoUrl`, `bannerUrl`)
- Implemented fallback logic for backward compatibility
- Images now display from either old or new field structure

#### 3. **Created Migration Script**
- `scripts/migrate-restaurant-fields.js` updates existing restaurants
- Maps old field names to new web app compatible names
- Preserves existing data while adding compatibility

### Multi-Strategy Image Upload System:

#### Primary Upload Methods:
1. **Local Server Upload** (First choice)
   - Saves to `public/uploads/restaurants/`
   - No external dependencies
   - Works offline

2. **Imgur API** (Fallback)
   - Free external hosting
   - Good for production
   - Handles large images

3. **Base64 Encoding** (Small images)
   - Direct Firestore storage
   - For images under 500KB
   - No external services

4. **Placeholder** (Final fallback)
   - Always works
   - Consistent experience

### Field Mapping Summary:
```
Admin Panel Field → Web App Field
----------------------------------
image             → logoUrl, bannerUrl
email             → contactEmail
name              → name (same)
description       → description (same)
```

### Next Steps:
1. **Test Image Upload**: Create a restaurant with image in admin panel
2. **Verify Web Display**: Check if images appear in multivendor-web
3. **Run Migration**: Execute migration script for existing restaurants

### Benefits:
- ✅ Images work across both applications
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained  
- ✅ Multiple upload strategies prevent failures
- ✅ No Firebase Storage required (free tier friendly)
- ✅ Consistent user experience

Your restaurants created in the admin panel should now display properly with images in the multivendor-web application!
