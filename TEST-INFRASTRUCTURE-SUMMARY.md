# Test Infrastructure Summary

## ✅ Test Infrastructure Complete!

### 🎯 What We Accomplished

#### 1. **Unit Testing Framework** ✅
- **Jest + React Testing Library**: Configured for multivendor-web
- **Coverage Reporting**: 70% threshold for branches, functions, lines, statements
- **Mock System**: Firebase, localStorage, Next.js router mocks
- **Test Scripts**: `npm test`, `npm run test:watch`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:ci`

#### 2. **Integration Test Suite** ✅
- **System Health Checks**: Validates MenuVerse integration components
- **Component Integration**: Tests that key modules can be imported and work together
- **Status Validation**: Confirms working state of restaurant listings, menu display, cart functionality

#### 3. **CI/CD Pipeline** ✅
- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Comprehensive CI/CD with quality gates
- **Multi-Job Pipeline**: 
  - Web frontend testing and building
  - Admin dashboard testing and building
  - Security scanning with Trivy
  - Quality gates enforcement
  - Environment-specific deployments (preview, staging, production)
- **Automated Testing**: Runs on push/PR to main branches

#### 4. **Quality Gates** ✅
- **Test Coverage**: Automated coverage reporting
- **Linting**: Code quality checks
- **Build Validation**: Ensures applications build successfully
- **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability detection
- **Deployment Blocking**: Failed tests block deployments
