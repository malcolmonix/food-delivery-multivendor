## 📊 System Overview

### ✅ **COMPLETED & WORKING** (October 2025)

#### 🍕 **Core Food Delivery System**
- **Restaurant Listings**: MenuVerse Firebase integration showing real restaurants
- **Menu Display**: Restaurant detail pages with categorized menu items
- **Cart System**: Full cart functionality (add, remove, update quantities, persist)
- **MenuVerse Integration**: Complete Firebase connection with proper collection structure
- **Modern UI**: Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

#### 🧪 **Testing Infrastructure** 
- **Unit Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library configured
- **Integration Tests**: System health checks for MenuVerse integration
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions with quality gates
- **Test Coverage**: 70% thresholds with automated reporting
- **Security Scanning**: Trivy vulnerability detection

#### 📚 **Documentation**
- **Simplified Documentation**: Removed redundancy, focused on current working state
- **Architecture Guide**: Reflects actual MenuVerse integration
- **Setup Guide**: Simple 3-step getting started process
- **Current Status**: Real-time documentation of working features

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE NEXT PRIORITIES**

### 1. **Complete E2E Testing** 🎯 HIGH PRIORITY
```
Status: [ ] Configure E2E testing
- Set up Playwright for end-to-end testing of restaurant browsing and cart flow
```
**Why Critical**: Ensures user workflows work end-to-end before production deployment

**Implementation**:
- Install Playwright for browser automation
- Create tests for: Browse → Select Restaurant → Add to Cart → Checkout
- Mobile responsiveness testing
- Error scenario testing

### 2. **Authentication System** 🎯 HIGH PRIORITY
**Current Gap**: No user authentication (anonymous browsing only)

**Next Steps**:
- Implement Firebase Auth integration
- User registration and login flows
- Protected checkout routes
- User profile management
- Order history

### 3. **Complete Checkout Flow** 🎯 MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Current State**: Cart page exists, but checkout needs completion

**Next Steps**:
- Address collection and validation
- Payment integration (Stripe/PayPal)
- Order confirmation
- Email notifications

### 4. **Admin Panel Integration** 🎯 MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Current Gap**: Admin panel not connected to MenuVerse

**Next Steps**:
- Connect admin to MenuVerse Firebase
- Restaurant management interface
- Menu item CRUD operations
- Order management system

## 🔄 **PHASE 2: PRODUCTION READINESS**
